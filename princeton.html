            <p style="text-align:justify">The main campus sits on about 500 acres (2.0 km2) in Princeton. In 2011, the main campus was named by Travel+Leisure as one of the most beautiful in the United States.[30] The James Forrestal Campus is split between nearby Plainsboro and South Brunswick. The University also owns some property in West Windsor Township.[4] The campuses are situated about one hour from both New York City and Philadelphia.

The first building on campus was Nassau Hall, completed in 1756, and situated on the northern edge of campus facing Nassau Street.[22] The campus expanded steadily around Nassau Hall during the early and middle 19th century.[31][32] The McCosh presidency (1868–88) saw the construction of a number of buildings in the High Victorian Gothic and Romanesque Revival styles; many of them are now gone, leaving the remaining few to appear out of place.[33] At the end of the 19th century Princeton adopted the Collegiate Gothic style for which it is known today.[34] Implemented initially by William Appleton Potter[34] and later enforced by the University's supervising architect, Ralph Adams Cram,[35] the Collegiate Gothic style remained the standard for all new building on the Princeton campus through 1960.[36][37] A flurry of construction in the 1960s produced a number of new buildings on the south side of the main campus, many of which have been poorly received.[38] Several prominent architects have contributed some more recent additions, including Frank Gehry (Lewis Library),[39] I.M. Pei (Spelman Halls),[40] Demetri Porphyrios (Whitman College, a Collegiate Gothic project),[41] Robert Venturi (Frist Campus Center, among several others),[42] and Rafael Viñoly (Carl Icahn Laboratory).[43]

A group of 20th-century sculptures scattered throughout the campus forms the Putnam Collection of Sculpture. It includes works by Alexander Calder (Five Disks: One Empty), Jacob Epstein (Albert Einstein), Henry Moore (Oval With Points), Isamu Noguchi (White Sun), and Pablo Picasso (Head of a Woman).[44] Richard Serra's The Hedgehog and The Fox is located between Peyton and Fine halls next to Princeton Stadium and the Lewis Library.[45]

At the southern edge of the campus is Lake Carnegie, a man-made lake named for Andrew Carnegie. Carnegie financed the lake's construction in 1906 at the behest of a friend who was a Princeton alumnus.[46] Carnegie hoped the opportunity to take up rowing would inspire Princeton students to forsake football, which he considered "not gentlemanly."[47] The Shea Rowing Center on the lake's shore continues to serve as the headquarters for Princeton rowing.[48]</p>

            <p style="text-align:justify">University housing is guaranteed to all undergraduates for all four years. More than 98 percent of students live on campus in dormitories.[129] Freshmen and sophomores must live in residential colleges, while juniors and seniors typically live in designated upperclassman dormitories. The actual dormitories are comparable, but only residential colleges have dining halls. Nonetheless, any undergraduate may purchase a meal plan and eat in a residential college dining hall. Recently, upperclassmen have been given the option of remaining in their college for all four years. Juniors and seniors also have the option of living off-campus, but high rent in the Princeton area encourages almost all students to live in university housing. Undergraduate social life revolves around the residential colleges and a number of coeducational eating clubs, which students may choose to join in the spring of their sophomore year. Eating clubs, which are not officially affiliated with the university, serve as dining halls and communal spaces for their members and also host social events throughout the academic year.

Princeton's six residential colleges host a variety of social events and activities, guest speakers, and trips. The residential colleges also sponsor trips to New York for undergraduates to see ballets, operas, Broadway shows, sports events, and other activities. The eating clubs, located on Prospect Avenue, are co-ed organizations for upperclassmen. Most upperclassmen eat their meals at one of the eleven eating clubs. Additionally, the clubs serve as evening and weekend social venues for members and guests.

Princeton hosts two Model United Nations conferences, PMUNC[130] in the fall for high school students and PICSim[131] in the spring for college students. It also hosts the Princeton Invitational Speech and Debate tournament each year at the end of November. Princeton also runs Princeton Model Congress, an event that is held once a year in mid-November. The 4-day conference has high school students from around the country as participants.

Although the school's admissions policy is need blind, Princeton, based on the proportion of students who receive Pell Grants, was ranked as a school with little economic diversity among all national universities ranked by U.S. News & World Report.[132] While Pell figures are widely used as a gauge of the number of low-income undergraduates on a given campus, the rankings article cautions "the proportion of students on Pell Grants isn't a perfect measure of an institution's efforts to achieve economic diversity," but goes on to say that "still, many experts say that Pell figures are the best available gauge of how many low-income undergrads there are on a given campus."</p>

            <p style="text-align:justify"> From 2001 to 2015, Princeton University was ranked either first or second among national universities by U.S. News & World Report (USNWR), holding the top spot for 13 of those 15 years[113] (sole #1 eight times, #1 tied with Harvard five times). Princeton was ranked first in the most recent 2015 U.S. News rankings, as well as #1 in a separate ranking for "best undergraduate teaching." [114] In the 2012 Times Higher Education World University Rankings,[115] Princeton was ranked 6th in the world. In the 2012 QS World University Rankings,[116] it was ranked 9th overall in the world, making it 5th among US universities. Its three highest subject rankings were 7th in Arts & Humanities, 8th in Natural Sciences, and 12th in Social Sciences.[117] In THE's 2012-2013 World University Ranking of Universities, Princeton placed 2nd above MIT and behind Caltech in Engineering and Technology.[118] Princeton was ranked 7th among 300 Best World Universities in 2011 compiled by Human Resources & Labor Review (HRLR) on Measurements of World's Top 300 Universities Graduates' Performance .[119]

In the "America's Top Colleges" rankings by Forbes in 2013, Princeton University was ranked third among all national colleges and universities, after holding the number one position for a number of years.[120]

Princeton Graduate School programs are also highly ranked among universities in the United States.[121] In the 2009 U.S. News & World Report "Graduate School Rankings", all fourteen of Princeton's doctoral programs evaluated were ranked in their respective top 20, 7 of them in the top 5, and 4 of them in the top spot (Mathematics, Economics, History, Political Science).[122]

In Princeton Review's rankings of "softer" aspects of students' college experience, Princeton University was ranked first in "Students Happy with Financial Aid" and third in "Happiest Students", behind Clemson and Brown Universities.[123]

The university's individual academic departments have been highly ranked in their respective fields. The Department of Psychology has been ranked fifth in the nation[124] and its individual graduate programs have received high national rankings as well. The behavioral neuroscience program[125] has been ranked sixth and the social psychology program[126] has been ranked seventh. The Department of History is currently ranked first in the world.[127]

Princeton University also participates in the (NAICU)'s University and College Accountability Network (U-CAN).

Princeton University has an IBM BlueGeneL supercomputer, called Orangena, which was ranked as the 89th fastest computer in the world in 2005 (LINPACK performance of 4713 compared to 12250 for other U.S. universities and 280600 for the top-ranked supercomputer, belonging to the U.S. Department of Energy).</p>

            <p style="text-align:justify">Undergraduate courses in the humanities are traditionally either seminars or lectures held 2 or 3 times a week with an additional discussion seminar that is called a "precept." To graduate, all A.B. candidates must complete a senior thesis and, in most departments, one or two extensive pieces of independent research that are known as "junior papers." Juniors in some departments, including architecture and the creative arts, complete independent projects that differ from written research papers. A.B. candidates must also fulfill a three or four semester foreign language requirement and distribution requirements with a total of 31 classes. B.S.E. candidates follow a parallel track with an emphasis on a rigorous science and math curriculum, a computer science requirement, and at least two semesters of independent research including an optional senior thesis. All B.S.E. students must complete at least 36 classes. A.B. candidates typically have more freedom in course selection than B.S.E. candidates because of the fewer number of required classes. Nonetheless, in the spirit of a liberal arts education, both enjoy a comparatively high degree of latitude in creating a self-structured curriculum.

Undergraduates agree to adhere to an academic integrity policy called the Honor Code, established in 1893. Under the Honor Code, faculty do not proctor examinations; instead, the students proctor one another and must report any suspected violation to an Honor Committee made up of undergraduates. The Committee investigates reported violations and holds a hearing if it is warranted. An acquittal at such a hearing results in the destruction of all records of the hearing; a conviction results in the student's suspension or expulsion.[85] The signed pledge required by the Honor Code is so integral to students' academic experience that the Princeton Triangle Club performs a song about it each fall.[86][87] Out-of-class exercises fall under the jurisdiction of the Faculty-Student Committee on Discipline.[88] Undergraduates are expected to sign a pledge on their written work affirming that they have not plagiarized the work.[</p>

                The Graduate School has about 2,600 students in 42 academic departments and programs in social sciences, engineering, natural sciences, and humanities. In 2012–13, it received over 11,000 applications for admission and awarded 319 Ph.D. degrees and 170 final masters degrees. Princeton has no medical school, law school, or business school. (A short-lived Princeton Law School folded in 1852.) It offers professional graduate degrees in architecture, engineering, finance, and public policy, the last through the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs, founded in 1930 as the School of Public and International Affairs and renamed in 1948 after university president (and US President) Woodrow Wilson.
